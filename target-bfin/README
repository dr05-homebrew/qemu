Blackfin QEMU port
------------------

There are some things we don't bother handling in the port for speed reasons.
If you want an accurate (but not as fast) simulator, then use the GNU sim as
found in the GNU toolchain (part of gdb).

Things we do not handle by design:

	- invalid parallel instruction combinations
		- no toolchain will output these
		- things like jumps

	- transactional parallel instructions
		- on the hardware, if a load/store causes an exception, the other
		  insns do not change register states either.  in qemu, they do,
		  but since those exceptions will kill the program anyways, who
		  cares.  no intermediate store buffers!

	- unaligned memory access exceptions
		- qemu itself doesn't support this for targets

	- AC0_COPY and V_COPY
		- no one has ever used these instead of AC0 or V
